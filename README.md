# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 15 - Biodiesel production in E.coli


## Project summary 
The imminent issue of diminishing fossil fuels has to be solved somehow. Our solution would be to use biodiesel as it is enviromentally friendly, clean-burning and a great renewable substitute for petroleum diesel. Our aim is to optimize the production of Fatty acyl ethyl esthers in E.coli to maximize the process. In our simplified model, we only did the optimization for stearic acid, as it is one of the most abundant fatty acids in biomass, but the optimization should work for all fatty acids. The chosen GSM model was of E.coli iML1515 as E.coli is one of the most studies organisms and we believed it would be the easiest to modify. Different  techniques were made to study and optimize our model like gene knockout, co-factor swapping, finding target genes for overexpression and downregulating,
## Project overview
Our project is organized in two folders Notebooks, Figures and then the Report.ipynb In the folder Notebooks, is all the analysis of our GSM model and our pathway to produce FAEE. They are numbered in order corresponding to the chapters in the Report.ipynp Chapter 4. Computer-Aided Cell Factory Engineering. The chapters will also have links to corresponding Jupyter notebooks. Figures in the report are also provided in the folder Figures. The used model iML1515.xml is also situated in the Notebooks folder
