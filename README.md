# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 15 - Biodiesel production in E.coli


## Project summary 
The imminent issue of diminishing fossil fuels has to be solved somehow. Our solution would be to use biodiesel as it is enviromentally friendly, clean-burning and a great renewable substitute for petroleum diesel. Our aim is to optimize the production of Fatty acyl ethyl esthers in E.coli to maximize the process. In our simplified model, we only did the optimization for stearic acid, as it is one of the most abundant fatty acids in biomass, but the optimization should work for all fatty acids. The chosen GSM model was of E.coli iML1515 as E.coli is one of the most studies organisms and we believed it would be the easiest to modify. Different  techniques were made to study and optimize our model like gene knockout, co-factor swapping, finding target genes for overexpression and downregulating,
